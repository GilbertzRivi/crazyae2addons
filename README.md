# Crazy AE2 Addons

Crazy AE2 Addons is a Minecraft mod that enhances Applied Energistics 2 by introducing additional features to improve automation and overall gameplay experience. Built on Java 21 and NeoForge, it is designed for Minecraft version 1.21.1.

## Features

- **Crafting Canceller**: Automatically detects and cancels frozen crafting operations, rescheduling them for seamless performance. Configurable delay before considering a task frozen.
- **Round Robin Item P2P Tunnel**: Enables round-robin item distribution between multiple outputs, between multiple item insertions. When inputting more items, the tunnel evenly splits the stack across all outputs.
  
More features coming soon!

## To-Do

- [ ] **Processing Pattern NBT Ignore Option**: Add an option to configure processing patterns to ignore NBT data for items returned to the network. This would simplify crafting complex items, such as entangled singularities.

- [ ] **Processing Pattern Modifier**: Introduce a pattern modifier enabling players to perform mathematical operations on input/output items in processing patterns. (all input/output times times sqr(2, 3), etc)

- [ ] **Pattern Processing with Success Probability**: Implement crafting functionality for recipes with a success probability. The system will attempt crafting in a loop until the required quantity of output items is achieved,
avoiding CPU clogging when a recepie fails.

- [ ] **AE2 Mob Storage**: Add mob-related functionality, including a Mob Import/Export Bus for mob integration or maybe even mob farms, all within the AE2 network.

- [ ] **Ultimate P2P Tunnel**: Create a powerful P2P tunnel akin to a wormhole, designed in true AE2 fashion.

- [ ] **Enchanting Table Automation**: Automate enchanting by allowing input of lapis, fluid XP, and items. Players can select an enchant tier (cheap, medium, or expensive) to enchant items automatically.

- [ ] **Scripting Mods Integration**: Introduce robust integration with scripting-capable mods (e.g., SFM, OpenComputers, or ComputerCraft). This feature may be developed as a separate mod in a different repository.
An example block that might be added would be a databse block, that would provide a database interface for scripts, but the data itself would be stored inside AE2 cells. 

- [ ] **ME Network Synchronization Across Instances**: Enable synchronization of ME networks between server instances on a local network. This could allow multi-threaded server setups, where different dimensions run on separate threads. Feasibility and implementation timeline are uncertain.

## Installation

1. Install [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/) for Minecraft 1.21.1.
2. Download the latest release of Crazy AE2 Addons.
3. Place the `.jar` file in the `mods` folder of your Minecraft installation.
4. Launch Minecraft and enjoy the mod.

## Usage

### Crafting Canceller
The **Crafting Canceller** block manages crafting jobs in AE2 systems, cancelling and rescheduling tasks stuck in a frozen state.

1. Place the **Crafting Canceller** in your AE2 network (requires a channel and energy).
2. Right-click to open its GUI.
3. Configure "Max Duration" (15â€“360 seconds) to determine how long a job can remain frozen before being cancelled. Frozen jobs exceeding twice the set duration are not cancelled for safety reasons.
4. Confirm settings to toggle the block's state (enabled/disabled). There is a visual indication, for both accepted and denied input data.

### Round Robin Item P2P Tunnel
The **Round Robin Item P2P Tunnel** ensures items are evenly distributed across connected outputs.

1. Set up and configure the tunnel in your AE2 network using a memory card.
2. The tunnel will automatically manage item distribution. Its round robin is enforced to the point, where only replacing the p2p tunnel, would make the items distribute not evenly.

## Development

### Requirements
- Java 21
- Gradle 8.12+
- Minecraft 1.21.1

3. **`CraftingCancellerBlock`**
   - Implements the Crafting Canceller block:
     - **Methods**:
       - `openMenu(Player, MenuHostLocator)`: Opens the block's GUI.
       - `useWithoutItem()`: Handles interactions with no items, opening the block's GUI.

4. **`CraftingCanceller`**
   - Core logic for monitoring and rescheduling crafting jobs:
     - **Key Methods**:
       - `tickingRequest(IGridNode, int)`: Monitors and reschedules jobs.
     - **Attributes**:
       - `enabled`: Indicates if the block is going to monitor and reshedule crafting jobs.
       - `duration`: Maximum allowed frozen time for jobs.

5. **`RRItemP2PTunnel`**
   - Implements round-robin distribution logic for P2P tunnels:
     - **Key Methods**:
       - `insertItem()`: Splits items across outputs.

6. **`Utils`**
   - Utility functions for cyclic distribution (`rotate`) and asynchronous delays (`asyncDelay`).
